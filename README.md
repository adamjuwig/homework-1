# Code Refactor Homework -

For this project, the objective was to restructure the existing code using semantic HTML elements without changing the behavior and structure when viewed on the web browser. By using semantic HTML elements, the code was simplified and organized to a simple, clean code.

In the original code, each section of content had it's own designated <div> class while using the same code and format for each class. When refactoring the existing code, only one class was used for the content found in each <article> and <section>. The code found in the classes contained values for color, display, and sizing. The navigational menu was achieved by using <nav> tags inside of the <header> tags. The links function successfully by creating an 'id' for each link, which is linked to each respective <article> within the <section> content. While the existing code was pulling the main image from the external CSS file as a background image, the <figure> element was implemented by creating a class to size the image properly to fit the website.
